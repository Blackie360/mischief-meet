# Database Sync Verification Results

## Current State Documentation

### Migration Status
✅ **Database migrations are up to date**
- Command: `npx prisma migrate status`
- Result: "Database schema is up to date!" 
- 4 migrations found and applied

### Prisma Schema Analysis
✅ **Schema contains the required fields**
- `defaultDuration: Int @default(30)` - Present in User model
- `allowedDurations: Int[] @default([15, 30, 60])` - Present in User model

### Prisma Client Runtime Test
✅ **Prisma client recognizes the fields at runtime**
- Test query with `defaultDuration` and `allowedDurations` executed successfully
- Client field inspection shows both fields are present:
  - `defaultDuration` field present: ✅
  - `allowedDurations` field present: ✅

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
❌ **TypeScript shows errors for these fields**
From `app/[username]/page.tsx`:
- Error: "Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'defaultDuration' does not exist in type 'UserSelect<DefaultArgs>'"
- Error: "Property 'defaultDuration' does not exist on type '{ id: string; email: string; ... }'"
- Error: "Property 'allowedDurations' does not exist on type '{ id: string; email: string; ... }'"

### Application Runtime Behavior
❌ **IDE shows TypeScript errors in the problematic file**
The file `app/[username]/page.tsx` shows TypeScript errors when trying to:
1. Select `defaultDuration` and `allowedDurations` in the Prisma query
2. Access these properties on the returned user data object

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be a **TypeScript type generation problem** rather than a database or runtime issue:

1. ✅ Database has the correct schema
2. ✅ Migrations are applied
3. ✅ Prisma client can query the fields at runtime
4. ❌ TypeScript types are not reflecting the schema correctly

## Next Steps Required
The problem is likely that the Prisma client types need to be regenerated to match the current schema, even though the runtime client works correctly.
