# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MeetMischief application currently has a broken passwordless authentication system. The NextAuth configuration is attempting to use email authentication without a proper database adapter, causing a "EMAIL_REQUIRES_ADAPTER_ERROR". This feature will fix the authentication system by implementing a proper Prisma adapter for NextAuth and ensuring the email verification flow works correctly with nodemailer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in using only my email address without needing a password, so that I can access the application securely and conveniently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their email address on the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL send a magic link to their email
2. WHEN a user clicks the magic link in their email THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user tries to sign in with an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors
4. WHEN the magic link expires (after 24 hours) THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want my account to be automatically created when I first sign in with my email, so that I can start using the application immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user signs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new user record in the database
2. WHEN creating a new user THEN the system SHALL generate a unique username based on their email
3. WHEN a user record is created THEN the system SHALL set default values for timezone and other profile fields
4. WHEN an existing user signs in THEN the system SHALL retrieve their existing profile information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive well-formatted verification emails, so that I can easily identify and trust the authentication request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include the MeetMischief branding and styling
2. WHEN a verification email is sent THEN it SHALL contain a clear call-to-action button to sign in
3. WHEN a verification email is sent THEN it SHALL include security information about the request
4. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and show appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to use proper database adapters, so that the system is reliable and follows NextAuth best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NextAuth is configured THEN it SHALL use the Prisma adapter for database operations
2. WHEN the Prisma adapter is used THEN it SHALL handle user sessions, accounts, and verification tokens properly
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN the system starts THEN all required environment variables SHALL be validated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't need to re-authenticate frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN their session SHALL be valid for 30 days
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN their session SHALL remain active
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be redirected to the sign-in page
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN their session SHALL be immediately invalidated
