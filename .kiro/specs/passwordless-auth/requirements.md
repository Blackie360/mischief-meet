# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete passwordless authentication system for MeetMischief using NextAuth.js with email-based magic links. The system will handle user registration, login, session management, and email delivery using nodemailer with proper database integration via Prisma.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in using only my email address without needing a password, so that I can access the application securely and conveniently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their email address on the sign-in page THEN the system SHALL send a magic link to their email
2. WHEN a user clicks the magic link in their email THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user's magic link expires THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user tries to use an already-used magic link THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want my account to be automatically created when I first sign in, so that I don't need a separate registration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user signs in with an email that doesn't exist in the database THEN the system SHALL create a new user account automatically
2. WHEN creating a new user account THEN the system SHALL generate a unique username based on their email
3. WHEN creating a new user account THEN the system SHALL set default values for timezone and other profile fields
4. WHEN a user account is created THEN the system SHALL store it in the PostgreSQL database using Prisma

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive well-formatted magic link emails, so that I can easily identify and trust the authentication request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a magic link email is sent THEN it SHALL include the MeetMischief branding and styling
2. WHEN a magic link email is sent THEN it SHALL include a clear call-to-action button
3. WHEN a magic link email is sent THEN it SHALL include security information about link expiration
4. WHEN a magic link email is sent THEN it SHALL be delivered using nodemailer with proper SMTP configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't need to sign in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL create a JWT session token
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN their session SHALL remain active for 30 days
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be redirected to the sign-in page
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN their session SHALL be immediately invalidated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to handle errors gracefully, so that users receive helpful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and show a user-friendly message
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle the error without exposing sensitive information
3. WHEN authentication configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to be properly configured with all necessary adapters and environment variables, so that the system works reliably in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL have a properly configured Prisma adapter for NextAuth
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL have all required environment variables configured
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL not show adapter-related errors
4. WHEN email functionality is used THEN it SHALL have proper SMTP configuration with nodemailer
