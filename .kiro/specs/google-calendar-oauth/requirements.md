# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable users to connect their personal Google Calendars to the MeetMischief application using OAuth authentication. This will allow the application to create and manage calendar events directly in the user's Google Calendar, providing a more personalized and integrated scheduling experience. By implementing this feature, we'll eliminate the need for a centralized service account and give users full control over which calendar their bookings are added to.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my Google Calendar to MeetMischief, so that my bookings can be added to my personal calendar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits their settings page THEN the system SHALL display an option to connect their Google Calendar.
2. WHEN a user clicks on "Connect Google Calendar" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to Google's OAuth consent screen.
3. WHEN a user grants calendar access permissions THEN the system SHALL store their OAuth tokens securely.
4. WHEN a user successfully connects their Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL display a success message and show their connected status.
5. WHEN a user has connected their Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL display an option to disconnect it.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select which of my Google Calendars to use for bookings, so that I can keep my meetings organized in my preferred calendar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has connected their Google account THEN the system SHALL fetch and display a list of their available calendars.
2. WHEN a user selects a calendar from the list THEN the system SHALL store this preference.
3. WHEN a user hasn't selected a specific calendar THEN the system SHALL default to their primary calendar.
4. WHEN a user changes their selected calendar THEN the system SHALL update this preference immediately.
5. WHEN a user's calendar list is being fetched THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my bookings to be automatically added to my connected Google Calendar, so that I can keep track of my schedule in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a booking is created for a user with a connected Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL create an event in their selected calendar.
2. WHEN creating a Google Calendar event THEN the system SHALL include all relevant booking details (title, time, attendees, etc.).
3. WHEN creating a Google Calendar event THEN the system SHALL generate a Google Meet link if virtual meetings are enabled.
4. WHEN a booking is updated THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding calendar event.
5. WHEN a booking is cancelled THEN the system SHALL delete or mark as cancelled the corresponding calendar event.
6. IF creating a calendar event fails THEN the system SHALL still complete the booking but notify the user of the calendar sync issue.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my Google Calendar connection, so that I can revoke access or reconnect as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Disconnect Google Calendar" THEN the system SHALL revoke the OAuth tokens and remove the connection.
2. WHEN a user's Google OAuth token expires THEN the system SHALL use the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
3. WHEN a user's refresh token becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to reconnect their calendar.
4. WHEN a user reconnects their Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL update their existing connection rather than creating a duplicate.
5. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL revoke any Google Calendar OAuth tokens associated with their account.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement secure OAuth token storage and management, so that users' calendar access remains secure and compliant with best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing OAuth tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data.
2. WHEN a user's access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it without user intervention.
3. WHEN making Google Calendar API requests THEN the system SHALL use proper error handling and retry mechanisms.
4. WHEN implementing the OAuth flow THEN the system SHALL follow OAuth 2.0 best practices and security recommendations.
5. WHEN requesting Google Calendar permissions THEN the system SHALL use the principle of least privilege, requesting only necessary scopes.
